\chapter{Deriving Guideline for Further Studies}
\citestyle{ustcnumerical}
Based on the evaluation results and qualitative analysis in Chapter four, we could derive a guideline for the further work in database construction. In this chapter, we will first discuss about the impact of video recording conditions for database constructions and then conclude the guidelines.

\section{Impact of Recording Conditions} 
From the former evaluation on our self-collected materials, there is so much experience that can be concluded and learnt from. In this section, we'd like to generalize a conclusion about the impact of recording conditions and this will lead to the formation of our guideline. 

The conclusion is listed as follows: 1)the significant movement will make the ROI defining step fail; 2)the illumination variation can prevent both ROI defining and illumination variation elimination from working; 3)although the talking scenario has better performance, the size of ROI is still influenced by the movement of the subject's mouth and leads to measure error; 4)the glass wearing scenarios seems not have too much effect since our ROI exclude the region around eyes; 5)the heavy make up makes the illumination inside ROI hard to detect, so that the step of PPG signal recovering fails; 6)skin colors are not the main impact factor but it still impacts the illumination variation detection inside ROI. 

\section{Guideline}
This guideline for further study concerning non-intrusive HR detection under realistic situations is very crucial and inspiring. Its contents are derived from our former discussion and here, we make it into a table to be more tangible.
